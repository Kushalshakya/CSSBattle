# CSSBattle

This repository contains my solutions to CSSBattle challenges. CSSBattle is a fun platform where you can improve your CSS skills by solving different design challenges.

## About CSSBattle

CSSBattle is a platform where developers can compete with each other by writing CSS code to replicate target images with the smallest possible code. It's a great way to practice and improve CSS skills while having fun.

## Challenges

Each challenge consists of a target image and a code editor where you can write your CSS code to replicate the target image. The goal is to use as little CSS code as possible while achieving an exact match with the target image.

## Structure

- Each challenge solution is organized in its own folder.
- The folder name corresponds to the challenge number or name.
- Inside each folder, you'll find a `style.css` file containing my CSS solution.
- Additional assets or resources used in the solution may also be included in the folder.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are my own interpretations of the challenges, and there may be multiple ways to achieve the same result. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out.
